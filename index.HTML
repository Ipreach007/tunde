  <td>
    I’m your host, Joel Spolsky, responsible <br> for just about everything on this site. <br> This is Joel on Software, where I’ve been <br> ranting about software development, <br>management, business, and the <br> Internet since 2000, although you may <br> have noticed I don’t publish too much <br> here lately.</td>

     <td><img src="joel.png" alt=""><br> In 2000 I co-founded Fog Creek <br> Software, where we created lots of cool <br> things like the FogBugz bug tracker, Trello, and Glitch. I also worked with Jeff Atwood to create <br> Stack Overflow and served as CEO of Stack Overflow from 2010-2019.<br> <p>Today I serve as the chairman of the board for Glitch, and I am the co- <br>
       founder, with David Wilkinson, of a new company called HASH.<br>
     </p>I served as a paratrooper in the Israeli army, graduated from Yale <br> University in 1991, and spent time on the Excel team at Microsoft where I <br> was the program manager responsible for the launch of VBA in Excel 5.0. <br> I’ve also written four books, do a lot of Arduino stuff and LED art, and <br>talk too much about Barry’s Bootcamp and Burning Man.
